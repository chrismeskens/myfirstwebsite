        <h1 class="why">Why learn to code?</h1>
        <p class="t-cod">Almost at par with literacy and numeracy, coding has developed into a viable, new language, essential for comprehending, interpreting and impacting the contemporary digital world. It’s a language that transcends age boundaries, benefiting young learners just starting their educational journey, working adults trying to expand their skill set, institutions and businesses as well as seniors casting around for mental stimulation and connection.
            Moreover, for many, coding has become an indispensable skill set to be employed—and this doesn’t just go for software developers. Of course, acquiring a whole new skill from scratch can be intimidating and time-consuming; therefore, people out there don’t even start this journey. 
            However, it’s never too late (and almost always worth it) to embrace the challenge and reap the rewards.
